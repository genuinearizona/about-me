  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Welcome, my name is <strong>Timothy Michaels Flores</strong> but feel free to call me <strong>Tim</strong>. Currently I am having such a great time learning Web Development and as you might have guessed this site would be one of my projects. There is so much to learn and so much opportunity
    to create! </p>
  <p>As a Marine I was a Field Radio Operator, after I had left the <a href="http://www.marines.com/home">U.S. Marine Corps</a> I held various supervisory positions, management and inside sales, all of which I enjoy very much. Oh! Also I served a stint in the Arizona Army National Guard as a Multichannel
    Communication Operator. However, its time to learn some new career skills</p>
  <p>I do have a long background as an Artist. My choice of medium are acrylic paintings in; cityscapes, landscapes, seascapes. You can find some of my artwork in sports figures or abstract paintings. I look forward to this journey and opportunities, cheers! </p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>Currently I reside in Mesa Arizona, but I was born in Phoenix Arizona, yes I survived the hottest day on record in Phoenix and that was June, 26 1990. We reach over 122 degrees that day, so hot I heard a fire hydrant whistling for a dog!</p>
